# SUNRISE- Solar Surface and Flare Real-time Imaging System  #  https://ahrefs.com/writing-tools/acronym-generator
http://eyes-on-the-skies.org/ is a backyard Solar Telescope built 1993 review article Sky & telescope September issue.
Originally remotly operated Linux BBS scripts over modem where text keys steered the telescope and could ask for a realtime download of the sun.
When internet on Linux BBS scripts moved to Web page and Apache server then on internet linux on static ip.
Now windows 11 Python code development between home and observator via wireless bridge and tightvnc.

Code here is that under developmnet for remote solar telescope control system.
I am using 
[SkyChart ](https://www.ap-i.net/skychart/en/start) 
which sends commands through Ascom
https://www.ascom-standards.org/
to operate the motion controler by 
https://www.siderealtechnology.com/
for pointing and controling the custom telescope fork equitorial mount.
The project imaging goal: 
to minimize data collected, 
camera and python source SDK for
https://player-one-astronomy.com/product/apollo-m-max-imx432/
project is to eliminate post processing by selecting 
Lucky images- that are least turbulant seeing thus least blured images - in real time.
Post PDF of noteworthy developments explainging as time permits the issues being work on at that time.
Learn advanced image processing to evantully improve these images a future goal.

The python def(s) and main code is work in progrees 
usually has the web link to the knowledge that enable this concept.

I organize a google meet every Sunday 12 PM PST as a group of 4 right now and welcome others 
interested in this type of project to contact me via email to mikerushford at gmail.com and 
we an then add you to the discussions, not strictly related to coding that I do myself.
